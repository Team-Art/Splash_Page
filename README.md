<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
Our mission is to help Artists showcase their art no matter what medium. 
Inspire, Showcase, Discover & Connect with Artists worldwide.


<h2>Challenges:</h2>
Creatives often donâ€™t get to take their art and make a living from it. They rely on social platforms to showcase it & build community. There is a need for a professional showcasing platform. We want to help those artists have a place that they can come and post their art in a professional environment. While also providing a space for people to discover artist portfolio work.
 
The creatives community come from all over the world, all walks of life & are brought together with one purpose. Sharing & discovering artist & art.
